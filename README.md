# HDFC-Bank-Analysis
In this project, we utilized the HistGradientBoostingClassifier model to analyze the historical data of HDFC Bank stock and forecast candle colors. By incorporating features such as Open, Low, Close, High prices, RSI, and average volume and price, we trained the model to make predictions. The HistGradientBoostingClassifier model achieved high accuracy on the training set and demonstrated reasonable performance on the testing set, indicating its ability to capture historical patterns and generalize to unseen data. 
Using the trained HistGradientBoostingClassifier model, we predicted the probabilities of the next day's candle colors. These probabilities provide valuable insights into the potential movement of HDFC Bank stock, enabling traders to make informed decisions. By automating the data fetching and analysis process, we can obtain updated probabilities without manual intervention. 
Overall, this project highlights the importance of data analysis and machine learning, specifically the HistGradientBoostingClassifier model, in stock market prediction. By leveraging historical data and advanced techniques, we can gain valuable insights and enhance trading strategies. However, continuous monitoring of the model's performance and adaptation to changing market conditions is essential for sustained accuracy and effectiveness.
